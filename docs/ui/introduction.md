# Introduction

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I love creating beautiful UI. After building essential components for Anu, I give my self happiness by creating UI out of it. This way I also know how Anu's component will look in wild and what's needed to improve.

I am currently doing this as my hobby. I might separate Anu UI in another domain in future but let's not make things complicate for now.

I hope this will help you develop UI faster ðŸ˜‡

:::info Coping code from UI
If you are coping code from UI, make sure to remove classes like `.cards-demo-container` that are for demo purposes only. When I will redesign the docs site there will be no need for it.

:::warning
Make sure to check for the code updates of the Anu UI until Anu is not well mature. Initially I will follow below:

1. Create UIs
2. Improve the components to provide the best DX and better flexibility
3. Update the UI
