    TODO:
    - We should create classes like `.a-title` & `.a-subtitle` to easily get styles for `ATypography` element.
      This will prevent use of component if we just want to render single element.
      After finishing this task, make sure to add "info" about when to use `ATypography` component and when to use typography classes.
    - Create new rule `s-\d+` then provide height & width. This is useful if we want fixed height & width of avatar instead of eye bowling it.
    - In below UI, we have to use important to override card spacer settings. Try to avoid that.
    - If I want to add subtitle at right of title, it's kinda hacky. Provide an easy way to render subtitle on right of title.
    - We can't set height less than h-32 for textarea.
